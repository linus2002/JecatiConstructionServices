        <div class="descriptiontwo">Established on March 30, 2017, Jecati began its journey in the construction services
             and rental equipment industry over seven years ago. Led by Rygs Tiu, a young visionary with a broad range of 
             construction experience, Jecati has built a foundation of first-hand expertise in all facets of the industry.
              Rygs Tiu's deep knowledge stems from hands-on experience, having personally managed hundreds of projects. 
              His understanding covers everything from meticulous cleanup to comprehensive product knowledge, forming the
               simple yet effective business model of "GOOD SERVICE, GOOD PRODUCT, and GOOD PRICE." </div>

        <div class="descriptionthree">As part of its expansion efforts, Jecati transitioned into a corporation on November 9, 2019, becoming Jecati 
            Construction Services Inc. During this period, the company earned an excellent reputation, frequently handling 
            large projects for local authorities, Japanese firms, and construction companies, along with smaller jobs for
             private clients. Today, Jecati employs several full-time crews and has established a strong reputation for 
             high-quality workmanship, covering the Industrial Economic Zone Area and all surrounding areas in Northern 
             and Southern Luzon.Maintaining full-time crews is crucial to Jecati to ensure consistent quality. By keeping 
             a dedicated staff, Jecati protects its customers from the potential pitfalls of third-party contractors. </div>
